# bcog200-final-project
1. My project will demonstrate the Serial Position Effect, where participants are shown a list of words for a short duration and then asked to recall as many as possible. The experiment will analyze recall accuracy based on the position of each word in the list. The system will collect response data, visualize recall trends, and analyze how word position influences memory. The results will be displayed in a graph to give insights on how cognitive memory works.
  
2. a. generate_word_list: 
   This function will generate a randomized list of n words from a predefined word bank.

   b. display_words: This function will present the words one by one for a fixed duration.

   c. collect_recall: This function prompts the user to type in as many words as they remember, one by one.

   d. analyze_recall:
	 This function will compare the recalled words with the original list, track recall accuracy by word position, and generate data for plotting a serial position curve.
